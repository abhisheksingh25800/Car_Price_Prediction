# Car_Price_Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. The goal is to understand the key factors influencing car prices and build a robust model that can predict prices accurately.
